            <h2>Who I Am</h2>

            <p>
                Hi! I'm Linden, a 4th-year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa 
                with a passion for low-level systems, game engines, and reverse engineering.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I specialize in building things without much abstraction — from ground-up graphics pipelines 
                to memory injection tools and UI frameworks. My main project is <strong>Kiwi3D</strong>, 
                a fully custom game engine written entirely in C++ using just &lt;windows.h&gt; — 
                but I'll leave that for the Projects page :)
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether I'm designing a renderer, writing x86 assembly, or poking at Windows internals, 
                I enjoy projects that challenge me to think deeply about how systems work under the hood. 
                I care a lot about code clarity, long-term design, and writing tools that feel intuitive to use.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm currently looking for opportunities in game engine development, 
                embedded systems, reverse engineering, or any role where I can keep pushing my 
                understanding of low-level software.
            </p>

            <h2>My Past</h2>

            <p>
                I've been coding for nearly a decade now. I actually started with C++ back in middle school, 
                using some version of DevC++ (an IDE for C++) I found online for free. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I built some ASCII-based games in the console window — like Block Breaker or a top-down 2D game — 
                mostly because I didn't know how to do anything with real graphics.
            </p>
            
            <p>    
                Despite having barely any resources (mostly Google and Stack Overflow), I found myself 
                drawn to systems where I could control everything — even if I barely understood how at the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, I explored other languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java, but I eventually 
                returned to C++ — this time with a much deeper understanding of how to use it well.
            </p>

            <p>
                I guess my love of low-level programming was always kind of there!
            </p>

            <h2>My Goals</h2>

            <p>
                I have a lot of goals for the near future, but I'll keep the focus here on my main long-term goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                My biggest goal is to build my own game engine and create a Steam-worthy game on it. 
                This goal drives most of my personal work — from systems design to low-level understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                My main project so far, <strong>Kiwi3D</strong>, was a stepping stone toward that vision. 
                It was built with no external libraries, but I've since realized that a no-libs approach 
                isn't feasible for a large-scale engine. Archiving Kiwi3D was a way to preserve what I built 
                and clear the path for a full-fledged version in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                My README for Kiwi3D even mentions:
                <br>
                <em>“A future version is planned, featuring a full redesign using Vulkan and modern tools.”</em>
                <br>
                <strong>That</strong> will be the full-fledged engine.
            </p>
